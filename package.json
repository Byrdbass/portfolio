  "description": "This website was created from scratch, and will function as a ongoing project to further develop my skills as a web Developer.  This will be a showcase of my coding portfolio.  Originally I have been planning on incorporating this into my pre existing [website](https://www.Lelandbyrd.com) - and hope to continue to use this code as I further progress into my coding bootcamp class. ## Wordpress incorporation At first, I have been working with my personal website and created a page called \"portfolio-coding\".  I ran into some issues with word press CSS styling overiding my scratch code and employed the following methods to start from scratch within my wordpress site.  - installed a plugin on wordpress to use multiple themes - used a theme called \"blankSlate\" to have this webpage attempt to start from scratch - installed a widget context plugin to attempt to get rid of widgets on one page in wordpress ## Immediate Actions Taken to submit for Homework Since I am planning on using this homework assingment as a tool within my own website, I have realized I am not taking into perspective the immediate goal of submitting the required work.  I plan to come back to these step in the wordpress site, but will press on to get these files deployed to gitHub pages in the mean time. ## Back to the Task at Hand After spending quite a while on learning how to get the portfolio to flex properly and pick apart how many gradients I can squeeze in - I realized I needed to get the site ready for submission, and come back to it with finer details later.  I got the \"1st Homework\" to successfully link to a new tab, and have it to the photo within the navigation bar.  I manipulated my recent photo and decided to float it on the right side of the screen.  After consulting with my sister, who is an interior designer, I was told to minimize the color contrasts in previous commits and focus on a more simple layout.  I was also advised to keep the about me section to just two sentences.   ## Later improvements coming! ![screenshot of the portfolio](images/ScreenshotPortfolio1221.png) [Portfolio Link](https://byrdbass.github.io/LelandByrdDotCom/)",
