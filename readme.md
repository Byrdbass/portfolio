## Wordpress incorporation
At first, I have been working with my personal website and created a page called "portfolio-coding".  I ran into some issues with word press CSS styling overiding my scratch code and employed the following methods to start from scratch within my wordpress site. 
- installed a plugin on wordpress to use multiple themes
- used a theme called "blankSlate" to have this webpage attempt to start from scratch
- installed a widget context plugin to attempt to get rid of widgets on one page in wordpress
